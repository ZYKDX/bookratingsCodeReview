# Porject Objective

A book rating page that allows user to rate a book in 0-5 by their choice. Also, user could leave a book review post, delete his own post and see other’s posts. At the home page, show the most favorites books list with ranking that was collected from users’ rating. User is able to sign up an account with email address, username and password, then sign in and sign out. This project applies the concepts learned in class by building a MERN stack application with React, Nodejs, Express, JavaScript, MongoDB, HTML5 and Tailwind.

Install and Run Instruction
Node+Express runs on http://localhost:4000
React dev server runs http://localhost:3000
**You need to add your `.env` file and config to MongoDB**

## Run it

Clone it, then

```bash
yarn install && cd front && yarn install && yarn build && cd .. && yarn start
```

And check your http://localhost:4000

## Alternative

For development start the two servers

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

And the backend will run on http://localhost:4000

```bash
cd front && yarn install && yarn start
```

And the frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
